ae6dda2b-b671-4053-b9c5-1fb9a43d9f66-2,the problem is that i can only block the game notifications after i get them.,1

344a2fc7-2088-4394-abb3-54945b9975bd-1,this will also contain force oars and on and on.,5
a4b4283e-d79d-4d35-a160-36138403d927-2,that s why this and every other game like it has such a low win ratio stars coins .,5

5d908a5d-5ee5-42dd-bedf-65b5a4d2f0d9,i wanted to ask this for a while now can we add friends in among us and we can chat and creat groups?,5
3dc09b42-c12d-4e03-b582-7bd13c477c9c-1,then out of nowhere it will stop working .,5
01a205a9-1e66-4320-a905-09c9aa0ad392-1,it is such a fun game it s a great game to play at restaurants while waiting for food.,5

f65141e3-1584-44d7-a77b-620134cee5e7,i am unable to download it to my device.,4
7d422de2-21a8-47bf-8321-df721f2804de,lots of other pop ups trying to sell additional decks.,1

b22daea7-bfa3-49c2-a343-e43b358b69d7-2,the problem is you have to get stars from playing one game only.,3
7fd80936-3811-483c-b738-8a34a03d5a0c,i just recently bought the game and personally i think it is amazing.,4

3f1f880c-12e2-410a-b200-c97b83bb6bb8,for example if we had 40 seconds left the pass screen stays put until the 40 seconds run off.,3

0755c464-dba1-45ab-b0d4-7956c638d8a3,"getting around 50 coins per mini game, which can take multiple lives to complete, isn t sufficient enough.",3
f724d164-9ae2-4d2b-88e8-e70055d729e2,it says that you can restore all of the packs you purchase in the app but that is not entirely true.,2
2a635b17-ea1c-4ddc-9977-839ffd87b5b0,"i ve bought several packs, but it is now basically a waste of money and memory space on my phone.",1

a3ca0bf4-1311-4c37-9cd5-0d527c73d26c,these are the two main issues that i have run into that others have as well.,2
fe8e7640-19fe-48b1-b41d-e8d7d0a4d4d9-2,"marmalade, if you want our money at least give us a solid game.",1
61b8be33-0038-49a5-ac8c-dafbd4e65d7c-2,so i was playing this game towards the beginning of its life and it had almost zero ads and the same opening for the longest time.,2
eb83b553-0d7f-4ef9-b825-230b0823b8e0-1,for version 1.3 the background city sounds are much too loud now!,2

02103620-6d8d-4004-8ddb-45e41c18599d,"so please,please,pleaseee do something about it!",2
809f2d16-115c-401a-b719-9c87a8d428cc-1,"first off, could you guys please make the game where you don t need wifi to be able to join people?",5
cd6f9a5e-c7b9-4f77-a354-4a21a5743ad1-1,"seems like a bug and i can t find any help, settings or tech support in the app itself.",1
b22daea7-bfa3-49c2-a343-e43b358b69d7-3,or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.,3
a7163cf8-6c26-45da-ace3-534d528a614e-2,but i would advise you to get this game.,4
940210be-1031-4e24-9fd5-a2f00ced823e-2,"however, whenever i put leave bed, it would kick me out of the app.",1
da6449fa-227d-4278-abb0-2b46820318fc-3,"some are do to bugs, and some are due to just poor design.",3
c2e0e3ae-32d9-402c-9bdd-f1e4b9f93738-2,"as friends, days, months, and years went in and out of my life, this game has always remained by my side.",5
c53ea92f-9422-44e3-b84d-0798d62eb06b,honestly hadnt played in a while but decided to try it again since we are stuck in the house and get some new packs.,1
8fcd581d-58b3-4135-82d3-21092abacc3a-1,"all the skins, and daily challenges gets me motivated to actually play this instead of any other game.",5
43efa2ac-5863-470e-80bf-6ce7d31da4da,"so innersloth, i m excited for the updates and ideas you have for this game in the future!",5

1875b2ed-8a09-4f2a-856d-8827a9a8c756-2,"this is a great game, but how many times should a family have to purchase the same decks?",3
a5667a29-093e-4a3b-91f6-78ea2cbf6f4b-5,"so, i also lose the game and not really angry but kind of annoyed!",5
34b9a485-c644-45f3-a4d3-a938ef1b4942,i downloaded homescapes because of the ads for it i saw on words with friends.,3
1dd5b244-e4db-4336-bac4-6cabed49306d,i would give this app 5 stars if i could ignore the battery drainage.,3
163582ce-af09-49d1-a5b1-990a69fd8eab,this extra step should not be necessary.,4
b68214e4-800c-480e-99db-8e49f4dffea4-4,the game allows you to work to deceive and lie to people in a way that is totally expectable socially because it s all for sun and games.,5
53a92568-a7be-4e74-9bad-06e3918266f6-1,we could be making millions of stars if the game let us get one star every time we make a power up!,4
7f791726-cc3f-4531-b422-1f096124b4c3-1,i gave it a 5 star review and i do recommend it.,5

76ef5113-1a63-4ae7-b0d4-c3aef39ff824-2,i also think that you should only have to face adds if your getting something for free.,4
cd6f9a5e-c7b9-4f77-a354-4a21a5743ad1-2,i d love a fix or my money back.,1
40bb688b-558d-4b7b-a113-f1510d46b8c2-2,i went back into the app and pressed on that deck but it still had the price tag on it.,1
6d9ae7f8-187b-4999-a92e-6ef51545ce07-1,i also like how you can get keys.,5
4c1501db-c3c9-4fbb-804e-9cebcf244c44-1,it was interesting fixing up the house but having to use multiple stars for some aspects and even to move to the next day is greedy.,2

5431fed8-7c83-4ea1-bc4e-c2282c6f1bbd-3,so the lag is probably the main issue here fix this please.,2
631d0698-6e55-4748-9bf0-d12140489fc2-1,"i m sorry this is so long, and i feel bad if any devs actually read this, but i ve wanted to get this off my chest for a while.",5

02103620-6d8d-4004-8ddb-45e41c18599d-1,every time i close something there s and add!!!!!!!!!,2
64a21ce7-a9c4-4cfa-9dbc-39ec5dc7ac8f-1,the butler conceit causes other problems as well.,4
0bca0bba-df15-4394-9014-47e7cc7af1cd-1,"i get that it s for safety, but even if i m not saying anything inappropriate i should still be able to say what i m saying not butchered.",3
df027d77-b236-4085-8f82-61f75e0331ad-1,maybe you could install a thing that detects their programming and stuff?,5
558fe3fe-50b3-4a84-8ca5-47ee23ebc5cf,i might have to delete it to spare my own piggy bank.,2

1773f558-5c9b-4ffd-9a6e-c771fd297e4b-4,keep in mind i was sitting right next to my router and had all my bars and yet the game kept booting me from the server.,1
b88fcfc2-5d23-4964-894a-b1b8f3486fc4-3,its really annoying how you can be playing and then boom.,4
c53ea92f-9422-44e3-b84d-0798d62eb06b-3,edit reached out to developers many times.,1
0755c464-dba1-45ab-b0d4-7956c638d8a3-2,i also think 28 minutes is a long time to wait for one single life.,3

93471e62-c120-40b4-8ac9-7c5510ab885f,it used to be free but i m assuming that there are more games and more categories on this amazing app.,5
a858f4f4-0ae5-45f3-9439-337fbf87c9a8-2,well it was but soon after we had to make a new game bc people weren t able to stay on our game with being kicked off for no reason.,3

e9a29e53-a69e-414f-bda2-c4775135e9b4-1,and if you want more decks you ve got to pay 20 bucks in 15 minutes or else it costs a whopping 100 !!,3

8bd75aeb-95b4-4e83-b978-62e3bc6b406e,the only reason why i did not give this app 5 stars is because of the disappearing decks.,4

0755c464-dba1-45ab-b0d4-7956c638d8a3-3,i find them to be fun and even addicting.,3
11c0a3e0-2c91-403b-93bf-6780dd3e8868-1,as the levels become more difficult even the boosters seem less effective.,2
ab997c38-aaae-4849-8076-f4699ce53e4f-2,also the 900 coins for 5 moves is a little annoying.,4
27e9a646-b13a-4c4b-bdcd-ba3385810aae-4,i play it enough i would probably pay it.,4

c72f5a40-c660-4d9b-ba45-835c73207359,really think the developers should have an option to just skip one if they can see you have tried 100 times and still can t get past.,3
e3c49efd-0501-442c-a09d-2d247e868e97-6,more mods are being used and hacking and cheating is getting more popular.,2

34b9a485-c644-45f3-a4d3-a938ef1b4942-2,"the ads mostly show the lead character, austin the butler, in a sticky situation and the player has to pull levers to get him out of it.",3

df027d77-b236-4085-8f82-61f75e0331ad-7,it s kinda hard to kill when people are guarding the cameras.,5
75c9ebd6-726c-42fb-ac1d-9908cac10128-3,the game updates every once in a while and often features a fun new addition.,4
1f05bde4-d722-4716-a08d-d0c348534829-5,my games were all lost and needed to be exited after this occurred and all that i worked for or played for was lost.,4
07a54680-7dee-41fe-8fd3-f1ddadf4caff-2,"we all know what s going on, and please don t play on it like we don t!",5
00ee8503-9fe4-4d23-99ed-809d015625da-3,the reinstalled version had the update.,2
007db83a-7e68-4010-9384-97f1062b726f-3,that type of gameplay is so small almost insignificant that it s pretty shady for them to put that at the forefront of their advertising.,2
9fd23038-b187-4030-a923-7497744b01a9-3,it makes it extremely hard and tedious to advance in the game.,2
037ac96c-d3c0-4ea8-9ac9-c41b32af2878-3,it seems to have a hard time figuring out that you are trying to move left when in midair.,5
bd88a672-933e-49f8-be3a-a4a24713b254-2,the most recent major annoyance is the red exclamation point on the shop button.,4
20fe016b-6255-402e-9230-de513fabde7d-6,to buy three hammers costs too much 1900 coins .,5

c252a40d-1994-4480-a7de-baa1c79b5787-2,this should have been impossible since there are only two repair cards one for chance and the other for community chest.,2

20375b65-5ad7-440d-8a8e-2bf50db3785f-7,this would make the game so much easier and i feel that it would defer toxic language because you can hear a person s voice.,2

7d422de2-21a8-47bf-8321-df721f2804de-3,i never got a pop up requesting permission.,1
5038e6e4-6548-44bd-bfa2-51d87410ba20-2,i think the developers should add some unlock able content that you don t have to pay extra for.,4
b614305a-04fe-45aa-a17a-911e740be0f8-1,otherwise it is a very good game and if they fix it maybe i can actually have a good time playing,3
c8f81cdb-7947-499c-a848-134e20f33309-7,it has usual free play features like picking tasks and being the impostor.,5
517ab64b-cde1-423c-a8b9-74bf123f781a,used to be one of my favorite games to bring to parties.,2

076c8d13-214b-43b2-b067-1923f7f42fe6-1,the only reason i put 3 stars is because the spend v reward is the biggest joke i have ever seen on any game i have played.,3
593a74f5-9d70-4912-b178-8dd988360e1d-3,the game concept is great but in order to advance expect to spend time or money on difficult levels.,4
1f05bde4-d722-4716-a08d-d0c348534829-7,this game takes the struggle out of someone having to be banker.,4

32c7a62c-0687-45c2-a2a6-f18a2acd1f56-3,i have little money to spend so i rarely buy helps but i do write reviews when i love a game and tell friends to check it out.,5
d9093959-bc2f-44cd-a7f6-2e303a590970-7,that should only occur if do not wish to.,4
dba947fb-b3f3-42c0-860c-ec54f15682d0-3,"also, when you win 2or 3 hours of free play, it should be put away so i can play when i want to.",3

eb83b553-0d7f-4ef9-b825-230b0823b8e0-7,this new version is nowhere near as fun to play.,2
84e7d6f7-ff0c-4cf0-8e75-91ed5f1b7c2f-3,plus when someone named lime or lemon doesn t get their color they leave and when they do it makes them look like a loser.,3
b3d79bc1-82a8-4101-be53-8e02b5b5e43c-2,so again please don t blame the game for those that have worked hard to permanently earn a spot in gold diamond.,5

8d31d8c1-df41-428f-8287-0efa4435c31f-7,the aquatic version is fine but the next version should be called....... real life but better.,3
75f8702d-5028-4d89-bc74-f911a553d28f-6,this is unfortunate for a game that requires a decent time investment to complete.,4

6d9ae7f8-187b-4999-a92e-6ef51545ce07-7,i also like how you can get keys by doing stuff like getting 810 coins in one run you can get 8 keys.,5

c1222625-740e-4c88-bf88-4a308205b878-7,this can be really scary for young ones and we should also not bring any thing political into a game that kids are playing for fun.,3
52c7fd8e-126d-45ac-81b1-41de698f97b2-1,and i can t find any number to customer service to see if they could fix it.,1
a89f92ab-95f6-4124-acc6-fef75388d09d-1,you can have an entire side of the board and they will almost always land on a spot that is either safe or really low value.,4
9fcf5204-d9d7-41e2-afe9-a17f890d7f44-4,"there is no way to rearrange, prioritize, or delete decks.",3

5038e6e4-6548-44bd-bfa2-51d87410ba20-3,i feel like an open chat forum would allow for more dexterity in the game.,4

00ee8503-9fe4-4d23-99ed-809d015625da-8,"so i deleted the app, reset my phone, and reinstalled it and the same things happened again!",2
66666fc7-36b0-43c6-afbf-af1879f6e44b-4,i also definitely think that younger players would enjoy this.,5

b3c91a35-19dd-44ef-b100-4a77109b4bcc-9,but besides all of the amazing stuff my game has been glitching hardcore.,5
365124c7-1419-4b82-9189-c8a60fd8e2f4-2,i get stuck on certain screens and get kicked off.,3
3c3cd1d9-218b-4120-ac08-cbce67ed96b5-6,but it can also be dived into sections of the game.,5
8f11f63e-45eb-4c46-a637-1529dbd8c9d9-8,and no company should ever send out an update that they know has problems they have to acknowledge in the update notice.,1
c7645b1a-4448-46fa-8235-80ed42286cf7-4,and have you ever thought that the among us players could cuss or say inappropriate stuff in front of children!?,3
68afb506-2141-4067-ba2f-958c28c0dc8f-8,nothing wrong with the gameplay or anything.,5
eb82eee2-8e7e-491f-9870-a600425d0284-2,"i have loved playing among us up until the new update, when they added a quick chat feature instead of letting you type whatever you want.",4
a1909824-969c-49cf-8fcf-ddeda45b71ff-1,it s a lot of fun to play with my family but we end up having to pass a lot because me and my brother don t often know all of the things.,4
bc980f75-9b5f-4a5a-879e-c66aa7fe490f-4,it tends to freeze more often than i would like or not count certain answers that were correct.,2
f193e637-a29b-4c7d-a58d-2a393ce79004-3,"and i couldn t bring myself to delete it, so i continued to play and basically to accept the challenge for what it is.",5

df5e1f23-ad45-454e-ac88-92d3fdc0d3e4-5,"in conclusion, this game only remains fun for the first 60 levels then gets frustrating.",2
9fcf5204-d9d7-41e2-afe9-a17f890d7f44-5,i can t really even access most of the decks i ve purchased because the game freezes or crashes as i attempt to scroll down.,3

f193e637-a29b-4c7d-a58d-2a393ce79004-4,all in all i would say that this is probably hands down one of the most fun apps i ve played.,5
10516dbb-0f2d-4246-a5a4-2980fac62540-7,this game has something for everyone.,5

5123ce3a-4366-4f88-9244-6a1120c59a85-1,that s when it gets extra funny because people are panicking and now you literally can t hear them talk.,3

b3c91a35-19dd-44ef-b100-4a77109b4bcc-10,maybe because it has smite 1 on the golden pickaxe but if so why would you give that out to people?,5

76789c61-7918-43e3-94f3-eb79f6970a91-9,the levels can be beat but it takes way too long to beat them sometimes.,1

ab997c38-aaae-4849-8076-f4699ce53e4f-5,that s usually like mid day or something when it comes up and it might take me 5 days to win the two levels to start a new day.,4

3c3cd1d9-218b-4120-ac08-cbce67ed96b5-9,but it has different things to do.,5

5b0fff4c-087b-417c-9cd3-51d951b90d7e-4,it actually de incentivizes me to buy a package because it never really feels like you are getting a deal.,4

75f8702d-5028-4d89-bc74-f911a553d28f-7,it would be great to have some kind of stat collection that keeps track of your wins and matches you up with similarly skilled players.,4
f4368d0f-0a57-4b31-a9b9-6a60b33ba90d-9,"if you get offended by swear words, do not play this game!!",1
9fd23038-b187-4030-a923-7497744b01a9-8,"it s not fair, and you are forcing people to spend money if they want to continue in the game at a reasonable pace.",2

4be3d701-2eba-4e88-9452-b4995ade354c-3,do you also think you can it where when you die you can a have an overview of the whole map.,5
76009c64-6bed-4e44-8ba8-3cec30ab3460-7,why would you make that strange violent ad to promote this game?,3
52c7fd8e-126d-45ac-81b1-41de698f97b2-3,"however, when restoring previous decks, not all will reappear.",1
0f9a9d3b-c04c-4350-8fd5-9e48ba935890-1,also they have different categories and you can watch after the game.,5

df6daab6-98d7-4504-9aa4-3318cf167ef2-3,totally recommended for people or children looking for that certain app they need in their life!,5
a858f4f4-0ae5-45f3-9439-337fbf87c9a8-5,the game rarely glitched and overall was the best mobile game i d found in a while.,3
b4d83b70-98eb-4f51-99a5-5ef3cb13cbf9-3,it s so much fun and we always look for new decks.,5
a5c6c8c8-73e5-4783-a586-c5b802ab1e62-3,"keep in mind, this is the mobile version, pe it s such a great game and i love it, but recently it s been getting more buggy than ever.",5

600892e8-1dd3-4d6e-b8ab-3614f766755e-9,you didn t need a star to make every call and 2 stars for a rehearsal.,2
938c22dd-c5df-4203-95d1-15f7354155d5-6,but there was a few i didn t like personally.,5
fe8e7640-19fe-48b1-b41d-e8d7d0a4d4d9-7,"the base gameplay is acceptable, but the flaws make the game close to unplayable.",1

7e8658fd-98b4-442e-9e1b-59a71baea109-4,i noticed the multiplier challenges...i m at 23x... but i was doing challenges...when i noticed... 23 30 is the 30x the max multiplier?,2
c1222625-740e-4c88-bf88-4a308205b878-8,this really makes me mad and frustrated because of how many times it s happened.,3
e3c49efd-0501-442c-a09d-2d247e868e97-9,"if you are reading this and are from inner sloth, then hopefully you will consider doing something to revive among us.",2
a742d087-bcc4-4c8b-b2d3-3c6d74172f19-6,"then, i think players should be able to use these coins aliens to buy hats or outfits.",4
62ff1b4c-3745-4bfa-9b91-450cad6a2c60-7,but when you have 10 more moves left and you win the level you are lucky to win 58 coins?!?!,2
f1c96862-490e-46a1-aca2-aeb4b365bc2a-6,wish there was a way to tap through it to speed up the process.,4
ebc2f58c-e309-4e06-8bcd-9d0a72522208-4,"other than that, the game s great!",1
70d02d85-60b0-4c94-a43d-0307f089e36e-6,the black screen glitch is extremely common and sometimes the lobby glitches into the map and the game is unplayable.,3
41877947-de14-47b7-a95e-cbbb3df0a97b-9,i didn t download the game to bake a cake.,3

936b1c3c-b4cc-40f4-adbb-04479fd17d20-4,i just want the game decks i paid for back i have my itunes receipt emails as proof! .,1
c35474b1-2973-4df3-adbb-ba437ff53bab-4,"i really love this game, but the fact i ve had it downloaded for 2 weeks and there hasn t been a single update is insanely disappointing.",3
93a875ce-2c7d-42da-9521-80788dd33e9d,overall the game is good but still needs tons of updates and work.,4
6bf3c637-7d82-4e98-8b37-32a23124786b-4,sometimes i open minecraft and after a few seconds of loading it just freezes.,1
2c41641d-6add-4ff4-8637-3bb152e5e2a1-6,if kids starting from the age of 9 can play this game there should be a way to report people saying explicit inappropriate things.,3
90f2ce84-ec02-4124-a106-2c2217809bce-5,big monopoly guy here so obviously i was excited when i saw this was releasing after being off the app store for so long.,2
acd4b0ac-8791-4d12-929e-8ae50188c307-5,"not only that, the game is 2x more laggy, the characters glitch while running, and the facebook friends aren t showing up.",3
6381441e-8a02-431f-963e-cd7174aa4fe3,"this game is good in regards to characters and visuals and controls, but there needs to be some changes to make the game funner.",3
7f791726-cc3f-4531-b422-1f096124b4c3-6,"something that really bothers me is that when i play a game and a battery thing pops up it will make me loose , but in this game it doesn t!",5

2ac64258-3449-4a03-a15f-ba5d86f62013-5,i wasted 2 hours playing a round just so it could crash mostly every single time.,2
f65141e3-1584-44d7-a77b-620134cee5e7-2,p.s i challenge you to a game of heads up!,4
9e0d17ec-10ac-4543-a54a-f9bea3699a75-3,"beware purchasing packs, they will not come back, even if you hit restore purchases",3
02aaf43f-842d-4c35-971d-38c7be5b5f92-2,so frustrated and disappointed!!,1
40b47786-3773-4019-a0a5-eba4542ce2e8-3,my favorite thing about this game is the hassle free games!,5
eb82eee2-8e7e-491f-9870-a600425d0284-4,but if you re over 18 you can use free chat and say whatever you want.,4
df5e1f23-ad45-454e-ac88-92d3fdc0d3e4-6,"instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later.",2
8e07c28d-b9a2-40dd-9cd8-98624b5dd653-2,"i will never make a purchase in this game ever again, so i actually thank this game for making me see the light.",5
e39b4bf9-5066-44fd-b62e-60765cf6361a-9,"in addition, let us make a choice, not force a play.",4
40b47786-3773-4019-a0a5-eba4542ce2e8-4,"just tap a few buttons, and boom!",5
f8fdee25-cbcc-46d8-b251-f45246b86689-3,i ve been playing this game ever since i was 5 and i loved it.,5
52c7fd8e-126d-45ac-81b1-41de698f97b2-4,i have downloaded the disney deck while at disneyland.,1
257afd1f-05c7-4a5b-8c05-b761d8de9d98-5,my daughter played this game as well and mostly stopped playing when the garden renovation began because she wanted to renovate the home.,5
74ab447f-2f93-4146-8a87-d39a3ce787a5-2,it was over a 100 value for just 20 bucks so i thought i was snagging a great deal!,2
a89f92ab-95f6-4124-acc6-fef75388d09d-4,"the switch is a bit clunky, however, this mobile version is pretty well polished even when playing with some friends.",4
85d7924d-c6d7-463c-a54c-1d5e57bb3812-3,"that part was a waste of coding and time for one little thing that they don t need, and it was annoying.",4
b5ccde8d-4282-46ff-a5f8-65fcd4e2fad8-4,so many things in each turn slow the whole game down and could be altered to keep it moving.,3
6099f2c3-16a9-4072-b38d-1218b2d5b3e4-1,it was a learning experience for the girls and sometimes the answers we all gave were often hysterical.,5
86dc9850-d69d-470c-ab75-11b40ea6825f-3,i hope the developers are working on this,4
f77aa41a-cd00-4833-a6b2-8496811f338b-4,but i don t usually spend any money on apps unless i know i ll use it.,3
8942fc45-24fa-4d34-b58a-909bd167ac62-4,or they still follow you and explode in creative mode in the mcpe i enjoyed.,2
76789c61-7918-43e3-94f3-eb79f6970a91-10,sad because it could be so much fun!,1
cc582f55-88e3-4df0-8e6c-dfc0eeeae32f-8,also you could chat with friends you re playing with separately.,5
365124c7-1419-4b82-9189-c8a60fd8e2f4-3,this goes for the counter offers also if green tries to trade pink pink can counter offer that counts as one offer each.,3
a123fe1e-200f-4f0f-a682-5645168b7ecd-8,just change the game back or tweak the update please.,1
a742d087-bcc4-4c8b-b2d3-3c6d74172f19-7,a second thing i would love to see added is a currency like coins or maybe something more creative like aliens.,4
3f1f880c-12e2-410a-b200-c97b83bb6bb8-2,it truly interrupts the momentum and any possible achievements.,3
1f05bde4-d722-4716-a08d-d0c348534829-10,i think their should be a time limit once they have handled they business.,4
34ba1c50-cb2e-4508-9ee8-8b0002b51731-3,the game itself is pretty fun when your group is large enough but can easily nicole and some you to death in the same decks.,1
33cd6729-ec66-480d-a3af-e48343aae0f6-2,4 the places are getting boring and it would be awesome if we can buy places!!!!,3
a858f4f4-0ae5-45f3-9439-337fbf87c9a8-6,so me and her tried making a new game and it basically told us we had been m.i.a when the game hadn t even loaded yet.,3
df5e1f23-ad45-454e-ac88-92d3fdc0d3e4-7,i m only in the kitchen and i spend on average 3 5 lives on each level.,2
ac374ba9-cf0c-4a8e-8792-ad695eeefc0e-4,"and also when i wanna do another deck, you have to pay.",5
70091570-bae1-4df7-aede-a4e67664e4a2-8,they are too long and they don t get shorter when you play a quick game.,1
7be24897-677d-4460-a3bd-3065f72b210b-4,"i had 38,000 coins, 31 keys, 40 tokens from the latest update, and 4 characters that took me a while to get.",3
4d50406b-98dd-4f74-8374-d3381ccd33df-3,i am truely disappointed.,1
8765dd75-e764-4d94-a2ea-f23c8894908d-2,great game keep up the good work!,5
40b47786-3773-4019-a0a5-eba4542ce2e8-5,"it lets you customize the game rules, too!",5
be579e90-a2a2-4a8e-ba8d-e5a4eee4ff20-8,i d also like to see the coin rewards have a better balance.,4
f193e637-a29b-4c7d-a58d-2a393ce79004-5,i can say that i really enjoy the changes that are taking place with the app.,5
70d02d85-60b0-4c94-a43d-0307f089e36e-7,"you may have added what i am about to say already, but if you didn t, you should add a age restriction.",3
ea63e840-e505-4291-8333-d395cc264782,this game is really fun and i know i ve said this already but it s so addictive!,4
92a1f4c4-8edc-4f46-bd28-856b77c7ec88-9,"though the email part is my fault, why did it sign me out?",1
143451fb-924f-4e50-bd7a-5bb5e4c499b2-9,i can t wait for the cave update!,5
0755c464-dba1-45ab-b0d4-7956c638d8a3-5,if there were events where you can play other mini games to gain rewards treasures i think it would be more efficient.,3
c24fd502-4b24-44fc-ae01-77da68da930b-2,it comes with a good amount of free decks and the ones that aren t free are only 99 cents.,5
c1222625-740e-4c88-bf88-4a308205b878-9,it logs them out of their wifi and disconnects them where they can or rejoin.,3
3c1e3064-9a7c-4fe1-b67e-8238c2bf667a-6,"i tried refreshing, i tried resetting my phone, i tried to get help from others.",2
470cb1b2-fd88-4cc4-875c-634c1fc53fbb-4,this is obviously built on that annoying subscription model for premium services.,5
fecb80a9-68a3-461a-905b-d403aa138349-10,"first of all when the game updated it basically restarted the game and got rid of all my coins, keys, characters...everything.",2
bf1cbc4e-97d3-4afb-84fe-73e8384c38f6-3,i tried for a week already and nothing works.,2
27e9a646-b13a-4c4b-bdcd-ba3385810aae-8,i play to earn the keys and coins through the challenges they give.,4
9e3c68dc-9912-4924-90ab-531ca4336bfc-3,"i m so fed up, i ve had this app sitting here for a week and haven t made any progress.",4
bf8a6c07-0611-47de-ad37-70bea17bd6e9-4,"all in all, the game is great, it just needs some minor improvements and maybe some more challenges to get the player excited.",4
20fe016b-6255-402e-9230-de513fabde7d-9,"i realize they do want you to spend money and i have but even when you spend, it doesn t give you much in return.",5
c9c75394-f173-4be0-9708-2f6236bfb455-2,"however, most of the games i ve played the dice have been fixed to my disadvantage, and normally allows one or two players to have success.",1
a5c6c8c8-73e5-4783-a586-c5b802ab1e62-4,anyone have any suggestions?,5
70d02d85-60b0-4c94-a43d-0307f089e36e-8,i used to play among us but not really anymore and here is why poorly maintained.,3
1dd5b244-e4db-4336-bac4-6cabed49306d-5,my iphone 7 got extremely hot and shut off bc the game used all of my battery power.,3
0bcc2e02-776a-42f9-b9b6-707f149845a9-10,"it s all based if the game allows the pieces to fall, the boosters to point in the direction needed to win.",3
5a9d92d5-6bb8-4fa1-bd82-f9b0d657834f-1,his relationship with katherine is uninteresting and all other characters are one dimensional stereotypes.,2
5f92cc62-f4ee-42dc-b019-f6d713086f69-8,the visuals are lovely as well.,4
231d1f65-3f94-4103-a882-dbceb86786fc-4,it happens way too often.,4
2838d3a6-135f-485e-bca3-984d0b9c8e7c-5,it s almost like a glitch or something that s not working.,3
c0191652-bf1b-41f5-966a-a0307b6144b5-4,"the game is fantastic, just like the board game.",2
fecb80a9-68a3-461a-905b-d403aa138349-11,and now for some reason the game takes forever to load.,2
82c971d1-6b81-46db-a3a9-97d81339bb51-1,the latest game i played it the imposter sabotaged o2 but then when it got to zero the numbers went onto negatives all the way to 11.,1
90a4fffa-948f-4240-8939-5a499787bed1,the only way to contact them is through email and without a phone number i m continuously ignored.,1
bacf00e0-2761-4de9-bce0-b2caf1d2e017-3,i m tired of getting kicked out of every game because y all can not fix your game.,2
6903bd00-7c60-4dca-a62b-93572c57dee8-2,this game ends up being a days at most because of demand for boosters coins to the cost ratio.,2
76ef5113-1a63-4ae7-b0d4-c3aef39ff824-6,my only problems are the prices of some of the items.,4
8fcd581d-58b3-4135-82d3-21092abacc3a-5,i also love that it actually takes you to real places in the world.,5
73e2045b-3463-4f78-a61c-9007328a0dc1-3,this has been an honest review of the game from me.,5
463114ee-2479-4606-9c01-66000395974b-5,i m extremely upset and will no longer be playing the game.,1
68afb506-2141-4067-ba2f-958c28c0dc8f-10,and it only happens when i enter the minigame.,5
f4368d0f-0a57-4b31-a9b9-6a60b33ba90d-11,i could go on and on but these are the main reasons why i gave it one star,1
c8bac288-b74b-47cd-804f-a670787ef0d2-3,worth the money!,4
939b456e-6d37-4160-adf1-a44fbfbb30dc-9,"thanks you reading this and i would recommend this game for anyone, even if these suggestions don t happen!",5
75f8702d-5028-4d89-bc74-f911a553d28f-8,is the game freezing from and idle player?,4
85d7924d-c6d7-463c-a54c-1d5e57bb3812-4,"i liked the game, but it had a few issues.",4
de269344-dbcd-44d2-9c5c-d3483118118c-4,and also my high score of 1.4 mil has been reduced to about 48k .,1
49e20b3b-8e04-44de-9b43-90dfce8a3e7f-5,"now, i have to rate it 1 star because i can t even play it.",1
c75e8cb8-ad9a-4b65-99cf-424664d3299f-4,"after playing one round, a message popped up saying that i had to double click in the right to keep playing.",1
b88fcfc2-5d23-4964-894a-b1b8f3486fc4-8,like a punishment for acting however they did.,4
68afb506-2141-4067-ba2f-958c28c0dc8f-11,i personally still love this game to freaking pieces so keep up the good work mojang.,5

00ee8503-9fe4-4d23-99ed-809d015625da-11,and it changed a lot.,2
76789c61-7918-43e3-94f3-eb79f6970a91-13,"instead i get to use my stars to feed the cat, call a taxi, or answer the door!",1
11b12287-015d-487d-89a4-6b78f3df0707-6,i ve always been satisfied with this game and have loved the changes.,5
75c9ebd6-726c-42fb-ac1d-9908cac10128-8,tl dr good game overall.,4
c110743b-7419-4252-8956-8375a3d4b325-1,but the updates never fix it and actually have made it worse over time.,1
3dc09b42-c12d-4e03-b582-7bd13c477c9c-7,it s a fun game that is for the most part easy to understand.,5
2ef6817b-d755-4f73-b77c-2a10ef70dfb4-7,something no game will ever get out of me.,2
acd4b0ac-8791-4d12-929e-8ae50188c307-7,please read the reviews and learn from your mistakes because this update was a huge one.,3
2a635b17-ea1c-4ddc-9977-839ffd87b5b0-2,"i ve reached out to support, but after reading the many articles on this problem i found online, i m doubtful they will respond.",1
66db8164-0e95-494e-86f5-1bd31483b6c3-5,this app has been nothing but trouble for me and i would like attention brought to this.,1
938c22dd-c5df-4203-95d1-15f7354155d5-10,it was the customize your own skin thing you guys added not to long ago.,5
c72f5a40-c660-4d9b-ba45-835c73207359-6,"additionally, i understand the game is supposed to be challenging.",3
b3c91a35-19dd-44ef-b100-4a77109b4bcc-14,when i went to go mine coal it gave me the ore blocks instead of just coal.,5
3792b613-aa92-400e-aed7-e93f24108d4a-7,i use slim armed skins because i prefer them over classic skins but the glitch only occurs on slim armed skins.,5
8bea10ce-ee88-4309-90da-8675e2e23e2e-5,i just thought of a few new mobs i would like for the developers to add into minecraft!,5
da6449fa-227d-4278-abb0-2b46820318fc-14,it s obviously great.,3
0f9a9d3b-c04c-4350-8fd5-9e48ba935890-3,it is really a fun game with multiple games inside of it.,5
68afb506-2141-4067-ba2f-958c28c0dc8f-13,so basically i play on the server mineville city.,5
62ff1b4c-3745-4bfa-9b91-450cad6a2c60-8,to get extra coins for more lives or boosters it is a lot of money for what little you get.,2
774c3069-2918-43b2-bb60-c3570538cbea-9,i mean that s ridiculous.,3
d4aead99-ff4a-41ff-8bc9-cb9a0621d702-8,my minecraft just kept crashing.,1
c1b05b5c-606f-4e9a-b551-562152fda229-7,although i do understand that kids do play and that might be the reason you did it but it s way to complicated for them.,4
81656bfc-0ef5-4d8f-9af2-a384e52545e3-3,i think that the game could be a bit better considering the fact that you have to pay to unlock new characters and boards.,5
8e26668c-7130-45b6-865e-63ebac66f997-7,overall the game is a four.,4
f65141e3-1584-44d7-a77b-620134cee5e7-3,and i will be happy to give five stars when i can download or buy byod.,4
631d0698-6e55-4748-9bf0-d12140489fc2-8,"mojang, thank you so much for making the best game this planet has ever seen.",5

c0105fd2-80e9-4afe-9305-b8da1f2b446d-4,minecraft is truly an amazing game.,5
5b0fff4c-087b-417c-9cd3-51d951b90d7e-6,just an interesting spin to make the game a little more addictive.,4
1f05bde4-d722-4716-a08d-d0c348534829-12,i am only giving it 4 stars because as of late a lot of the games i have been in the middle of playing will just not be able to resume.,4
00816c5d-178b-4f56-a525-3a886b4e1794-6,this also ensures equal odds of getting a card.,2
9fd23038-b187-4030-a923-7497744b01a9-10,"not keep us at 1 star per level, but the higher we go tasks are costing us 6 12 stars per task, come on!!",2
c8bac288-b74b-47cd-804f-a670787ef0d2-4,i m very addicted to this monopoly game app!,4
a123fe1e-200f-4f0f-a682-5645168b7ecd-10,"i have played this game for a long time, and it has been such a fun way to connect with friends and family.",1
bd88a672-933e-49f8-be3a-a4a24713b254-6,"i ll rate subway surfers as 5 if the ad issues are solved, because the game play and reward system is great.",4
05590763-4b38-4019-9f38-1b1a84e778f5-10,", get cool characters, and enjoy running in the subway.",5
99da3289-e808-4df7-84ce-b8a6842d81bd-9,but these old parlor games deserve at least a minimal social component to keep people returning.,3
40b47786-3773-4019-a0a5-eba4542ce2e8-6,"it is so easy to use, and the 4 dollars that i paid for it was so worth it!",5
6a6964eb-2cbd-4799-b6ea-7d5c7be16118-2,another problem i have with is with the whole subway surfers theme.,2
70091570-bae1-4df7-aede-a4e67664e4a2-9,"first of all, they stopped updating the older version to force people to buy a newer, in my opinion, worse version.",1
b1d7e299-ad74-4e9b-b627-49572b67176b-11,"on the other hand, there are some ridiculous hashtags marked on a word that isn t even bad!",5
9618d781-ea0a-4dbd-acbf-2b0c8986d54f-2,use it for family events and friendly get togethers!,5
e3c49efd-0501-442c-a09d-2d247e868e97-11,"people say it s my bad wifi, but that s not true because my wifi works perfectly fine.",2
059f1b92-eeac-4467-85a3-9a30294350eb-2,"i enjoy playing this with my friends, we all have a good time!",4
1f456097-1aef-40b0-8ef7-994628f94cee-6,you ll often lose by 1 move which prompts you to use coins to buy 5 more moves.,2
ee6dd0b3-f2d2-4c21-8817-0e20ec74cbb2-9,"the game was relatively easy to play, and fun.",3
1b28734e-e8eb-4834-8022-e025b301fd47-3,"instead, it crashes immediately.",1
bacf00e0-2761-4de9-bce0-b2caf1d2e017-4,and i don t think people should be able to leave the room once the game starts.,2
07a54680-7dee-41fe-8fd3-f1ddadf4caff-6,"if that were the case, you wouldn t have a bunch of people complaining about the way the game plays and cheats!",5
05590763-4b38-4019-9f38-1b1a84e778f5-11,"i would like to give a shoutout to whoever made this game because it is fabulous, no matter what others say.",5
cafdaaf9-ddc7-4ea3-abf2-5fa9fc8481b7-6,this game is really great in a lot of ways.,4
04d85362-ec6f-4961-a38c-ffbcc7f40f13-7,update i ve now discovered that the automatic role system is very bad for me.,5
bf8a6c07-0611-47de-ad37-70bea17bd6e9-5,i also would like to see the game have challenges instead of only being able to run on an endless road.,4
2b3b8503-11d9-49ad-8601-ee75ed9f1947-8,"here is where i know most people would be incredibly angry this is a 3 million 2 hour score, you know?",1
cc582f55-88e3-4df0-8e6c-dfc0eeeae32f-12,among us is an amazing game and i ve become obsessed with it over the past couple months.,5
5cc23a14-71fb-48d8-a75a-5eecb344fd6c-4,"like seeing different colored trains, different buildings, etc.",5
7d422de2-21a8-47bf-8321-df721f2804de-5,actually i couldn t find options at all in the game.,1
ef25299a-c3a7-4c6d-8af0-3d58f05ba757-2,i have recently deleted the app because of this.,2
27e9a646-b13a-4c4b-bdcd-ba3385810aae-9,the game overall is fun and addictive.,4
da6449fa-227d-4278-abb0-2b46820318fc-15,2 background music stops when minecraft is launched.,3
61b8be33-0038-49a5-ac8c-dafbd4e65d7c-8,if you want it to be like majority of the other running games going around right now then this game is definitely for you.,2
ee6dd0b3-f2d2-4c21-8817-0e20ec74cbb2-10,when we would ask what did you do for the weekend amoung us would be a popular game they all played.,3
938c22dd-c5df-4203-95d1-15f7354155d5-11,this is the game i love and will always love but just remove some of the updates you think made the game better.,5
2838d3a6-135f-485e-bca3-984d0b9c8e7c-10,"i ve tried to be patient and play the games out without spending money, but many levels you just can t!",3
bf1cbc4e-97d3-4afb-84fe-73e8384c38f6-4,now that the top run table never appears for me i ve became extremely frustrated.,2
3e32f1ac-3c39-4c5f-b19b-676344a957c1-1,we always play this with our neighbors at the lake when our families gather in the summer.,5
c8f81cdb-7947-499c-a848-134e20f33309-14,i will be awaiting your response.,5
3e32f1ac-3c39-4c5f-b19b-676344a957c1-2,it is great.,5
6de1e1fa-4abb-4bfd-b50b-962d43e129e1-10,i would really recommend downloading this game on your phone or ipad right now.,1
9699ffb2-4a50-49b2-b6e6-63056059952d-2,it s a fun game but the quick chat update has limited what i can say and the options don t allow me to say what i usually would.,5
bd88a672-933e-49f8-be3a-a4a24713b254-7,first was ads that would play after clicking on the home icon.,4
c6eb6fad-e70f-459f-a0d3-b25786179331-6,it gets to the point where it is offering trades on every dice roll which slows the game down.,4
1f05bde4-d722-4716-a08d-d0c348534829-13,wish the tokens were a bit cheaper and more options.,4
f2a46d13-f77a-4a41-a7ad-d82ef91ecff3-2,"even though the game is 1, this version really should be free based on its current quality.",1
6d9ae7f8-187b-4999-a92e-6ef51545ce07-10,keys are things that are hard to get but you can get a lot of stuff with them like outfits and hoverboards.,5
257afd1f-05c7-4a5b-8c05-b761d8de9d98-7,i can see how those with less patience would easily give up if they want home renovation instead of the garden.,5
7650780e-fcc0-4e86-9ab4-d5caae581895-2,does anyone remember monopoly here now??,4
a3956d99-77f6-4ecd-b23b-c1f00faef7fb-9,"and if it s all done right and very cleanly, i might even consider the unthinkable paying for some of the maps and tokens.",3
0bca0bba-df15-4394-9014-47e7cc7af1cd-7,that s why i deleted it and downloaded it again so i could change the birthdate i put on it.,3
5b0fff4c-087b-417c-9cd3-51d951b90d7e-7,"not going to lie, at those moments it really is frustrating because you get only 5 lives and the regeneration rate is slow.",4
231d1f65-3f94-4103-a882-dbceb86786fc-6,maybe that s because of the free parking rule.,4
cf3aa25a-d36a-4b2b-bffb-76e87f4fac74-5,i played on it for an hour or two and i turned it off and didn t touch it.,2
d9093959-bc2f-44cd-a7f6-2e303a590970-9,this is like an upgraded version.,4
5a9d92d5-6bb8-4fa1-bd82-f9b0d657834f-2,i keep playing thinking it will get better but sadly it does not.,2
ee6dd0b3-f2d2-4c21-8817-0e20ec74cbb2-11,i downloaded the app and found myself loving it!,3
e39b4bf9-5066-44fd-b62e-60765cf6361a-10,to spend and spend and never win anything back except 50 coins to 100 coins is disheartening.,4
38e28d0f-777f-4534-b0a4-eaf8c6839d10-2,"i m now finding out that i have to pay for realms, the add friends, and play with them.",3
22f8c1cb-2e25-4535-aa6a-84cc051a5c80-2,this game is very fun except sometimes you have to start completely over and reset everything!,2
558fe3fe-50b3-4a84-8ca5-47ee23ebc5cf-7,but here i am still playing.,2
28608353-57c6-49f1-a987-1432f11b0d5f-10,"i have no clue why, we ve already paid for the game, but they do.",1
2d89c788-9230-447e-aa9b-8d90d6ed63b3-5,"so overall, this game is pretty good, but it could use some improvements.",4
218937dd-7fab-4463-8b87-5b728223f544-2,"about the bugs, are very annoying.",3
c2e0e3ae-32d9-402c-9bdd-f1e4b9f93738-6,a game that taught us to never put a boundary to our imagination.,5
c35474b1-2973-4df3-adbb-ba437ff53bab-5,and both are constant!,3
84e7d6f7-ff0c-4cf0-8e75-91ed5f1b7c2f-4,man i hate these types of people.,3
40b47786-3773-4019-a0a5-eba4542ce2e8-7,another great thing about this game is that it saves your games!,5

a742d087-bcc4-4c8b-b2d3-3c6d74172f19-9,"then, players should receive say, 5 aliens or coins if they win as a crew mate and 10 aliens or coins if they win as imposter.",4
531e7c70-d2bd-408c-8d4d-cc18221702cd-10,minecraft should be safe and fun!,3

8d31d8c1-df41-428f-8287-0efa4435c31f-11,for your next few updates you should definitely do halloween christmas phones new mobs curtains and etc.,3
5ab69fba-0045-4b22-bcee-38bfb32e36c2-6,there s hardly a way to progress with the limited number.,5

441c2055-2b7d-4c3a-939a-5faa779168bf-10,"at first, because the ai is on easy mode, i to great!",3
52fe3593-9dd5-4958-af59-b746e2ad7081-8,i nicked a star because they game against computer players is quite obviously not random.,5
ea63e840-e505-4291-8333-d395cc264782-1,thank you for reading if you did!,4
c8f81cdb-7947-499c-a848-134e20f33309-15,for example i start up free play and see an option saying would you like to turn on intelligent mode? i turn it on and free play starts.,5
a59dd52a-732b-49cc-bc48-909b0541508d-2,it was like there was invisible blocks that kept going and going and going and going.,3

814af1ac-a996-4e72-ac48-54d064d5c457-7,make it 1 to 6 so that old players such as myself can play the game optimally.,3
249a48ad-4f2a-4a92-8ad2-357bf8958cd2-1,love this app and the team worked quickly to fix the most recent bugs where the app wouldn t open for the 5th anniversary update.,5
fe8e7640-19fe-48b1-b41d-e8d7d0a4d4d9-9,the connection errors bugs are ridiculous and make it rare to get a solid game in.,1

828d34d3-df0b-417b-8cf9-84db61e10dcf-8,so if you wanted to change something with gardenscapes that would be one thing.,5
b3921be1-2296-4d9e-a5cf-55d059671fad-1,very disappointed considering how much i paid for the game.,1

886241a5-5141-4258-9fe0-0e0c31515ac3-13,"other than that, its a great game!",3
04d85362-ec6f-4961-a38c-ffbcc7f40f13-8,i don t understand why people do this.,5
7546a988-1570-4351-ba5e-7f296f0a2f15-7,"otherwise i just won t play online which is fine but it would be nice to play humans, as the computer is not a person.",4
b0627afb-80de-4297-9673-7ddaafdbf463-5,but it freezes way too often.,5
38e28d0f-777f-4534-b0a4-eaf8c6839d10-3,"if you aren t, you must sign into minecraft using your x box account, which for a while i didn t have.",3
5ab69fba-0045-4b22-bcee-38bfb32e36c2-7,i know it s realistic but the app should be a little more advanced and fix tedious things like that.,5
d51897a9-5a12-4e73-8cd9-74446892f446-8,"now i do think the fact they are called hard levels makes it better for us to prepare, and definitely the coin amount there is worth it.",4
487d6948-5d0e-42dc-92a0-c04b424ae746-3,"the bored is still moving, but i m not getting paid.",4
66666fc7-36b0-43c6-afbf-af1879f6e44b-7,"to anyone who reads my review, i highly suggest this game! have a good day!!",5
bdfe31b1-8f12-46f7-a663-7cb912e7614d-3,i play it all the time at work and at home.,5
4420b5e3-7ff7-4ad8-9c83-119fd5eaa8cd-9,"anyway, thank you for reading my comment.",3
0bc7d046-f22a-4344-b806-9d02d9493bec-6,for example piano tiles has ads where you can type in the song you want and play it but in the actual app you have to unlock songs.,5
0f830248-ffa4-4ccb-993f-e89b87a64ce1-5,i recently made a new world titled covid is killing my brain cells where i used everything from the inventory.,5
605a6501-2804-42df-b770-79e812b05aa0-1,"but the thing is if you have a really good score the week before, it all goes away the next week!!!",3
33e43d6f-315c-4cc8-b36f-96a9cebde2cf-5,or was it 1 million?,5
ac0179c2-47df-4783-8a70-474eba172c7b-4,i would love it if they removed the quick chat.,3
2ac64258-3449-4a03-a15f-ba5d86f62013-7,the game can stop and crash at any point in the game.,2
3dc09b42-c12d-4e03-b582-7bd13c477c9c-9,it s fun for all and good teaching game and well.,5
cc582f55-88e3-4df0-8e6c-dfc0eeeae32f-13,those are a few small but very effective features i think us among us users would love and highly appreciate!,5
0e8274f4-2292-4fd1-ad28-b6f085597ae8-12,"seriously, i highly recommend minecraft.",5
a858f4f4-0ae5-45f3-9439-337fbf87c9a8-7,let me explain the last one or why i can t say i love the game anymore.,3
d4aead99-ff4a-41ff-8bc9-cb9a0621d702-9,yet with this disgustingly glitchy xbox live sign in and sign out if you re still signed in you can t even play without wifi.,1
774c3069-2918-43b2-bb60-c3570538cbea-10,the levels seem to get really difficult after you start renovating the third room.,3
059f1b92-eeac-4467-85a3-9a30294350eb-3,although you don t know people you play with in random servers it s fun playing with them to.,4
8f11f63e-45eb-4c46-a637-1529dbd8c9d9-12,all of my worlds have been corrupted since the latest update went live.,1
a123fe1e-200f-4f0f-a682-5645168b7ecd-11,also look at all of the reviews your getting.,1
5d4d70d0-97c7-48a7-888e-de639cf0310d-2,the math or algorithm behind the dice roll needs to be addressed before i can enjoy this game.,1
44530381-2add-47fb-abf7-dc495b37841c-5,above all else the game play is so very unfair.,5
8d31d8c1-df41-428f-8287-0efa4435c31f-12,and i have pretty good stuff on survival.,3
1f3846dd-0e53-45b2-8118-1f95012511b0-12,"i do not recall anyone who has this problem that i know, but that is because most of my friends do not play subway surfers.",3
34b9a485-c644-45f3-a4d3-a938ef1b4942-9,the idea of course is to get the player to purchase items to play longer.,3
f229a72a-55ea-4450-b176-b63839af52b4-6,"2nd, the nether is completely ruined and there is no way to beat the ender dragon without cheating.",1
7f791726-cc3f-4531-b422-1f096124b4c3-7,the last thing i am saying is you should get this !,5
4be3d701-2eba-4e88-9452-b4995ade354c-5,i really hope you can consider them.,5
c6fc1d76-0d61-4526-9c6b-0a69b432499e-2,when the ai did land it was a surprise.,3
9097fd78-bbb1-40d1-a0e4-f446eeec6c8b-5,the items in the game are also way too expensive.,2
82c971d1-6b81-46db-a3a9-97d81339bb51-4,also a lot of the time when you quick chat the letters are not in the chat box you made it s just somewhere out of it!,1
a59dd52a-732b-49cc-bc48-909b0541508d-3,"and literally 2 minutes later, the lag would end and i could go forward on my horse again.",3
a7163cf8-6c26-45da-ace3-534d528a614e-8,we don t get enough coins for winning levels!,4
f77aa41a-cd00-4833-a6b2-8496811f338b-6,i don t have to win all the time and make enough mistakes to know why i ve lost.,3
44bd0b80-64c7-4823-aef5-85f4fa1348f7-2,the greatest hits and family fun packs are 50 off but still cost 9 10!,1
c0191652-bf1b-41f5-966a-a0307b6144b5-5,"you ll make a trade offer, only for the game to freeze and be impossible to resume.",2
f77aa41a-cd00-4833-a6b2-8496811f338b-7,i m hoping for change as my thoughts seem to be repeated over and over again in the reviews.,3
a1909824-969c-49cf-8fcf-ddeda45b71ff-2,"it could use an update with new, free packs such as 2000 celebs, guess the lullaby could be fun, 2000 movies, etc.",4
c6eb6fad-e70f-459f-a0d3-b25786179331-7,"for the custom rule set, having an option to start the game with more money would be nice.",4
c0370f0a-c32f-49bf-9853-0923ec385663-7,beating difficult levels may have taken multiple attempts but didn t require having to spend money.,5
828d34d3-df0b-417b-8cf9-84db61e10dcf-9,i don t want to stop playing but i run out of lives so i have no choice.,5
56cc4683-5245-4865-9c74-c66f71f6ea4b-4,"and then some of us would rather play roblox, minecraft, gta, that sort of stuff instead.",3
cbb6bf1b-ba47-4c53-a15d-b4fd78dc65ac-1,"my boyfriend and i absolutely love this game, it s our late night go to fun but it just started freezing.",5
e5664a8b-3418-4b00-ba76-20ff1fcd9680-7,please correct it as it s falsely advertising a feature of this game.,3
037ac96c-d3c0-4ea8-9ac9-c41b32af2878-8,i just downloaded the most recent update to the update and it seems to be a bit better.,5
5cc23a14-71fb-48d8-a75a-5eecb344fd6c-5,"getting straight back to my point, the update is fine.",5
143451fb-924f-4e50-bd7a-5bb5e4c499b2-11,"i remember surprise friday or friday surprise, but then it stopped.",5
a5c6c8c8-73e5-4783-a586-c5b802ab1e62-7,it gets to the last couple of bars in the loading screen and freezes.,5
165d5bff-ab17-4f58-85c9-af4c2eb3c5fc-6,the graphics are also poorer in my opinion as well.,1
11293db1-2d99-4eb5-9be7-6e3ad9334309-7,they should really listen and make some serious changes to fix what could be a wonderful game.,3
bdfe31b1-8f12-46f7-a663-7cb912e7614d-4,the themed boards are so beautiful.,5
14c49adc-d4c3-4d8c-85ba-71f035cf98a3-8,i tried hard difficulty and all it seemed to do was diminish my luck and not make dealing with ai more difficult.,2
c35474b1-2973-4df3-adbb-ba437ff53bab-6,"you know this is the most popular game on the market right now, so please stop ignoring these issues and make the effort to fix them.",3
b3d79bc1-82a8-4101-be53-8e02b5b5e43c-6,thank you developers of the game who made the game so perfect!,5
959a79c9-3b10-495c-ab57-0f9483d7a6fc-3,the only thing is i wish they had some more free categories but honestly i use this app so much i don t mind for some extra sets!,5
e9a29e53-a69e-414f-bda2-c4775135e9b4-3,"just saying, in case you want to fix this issue.",3
4be3d701-2eba-4e88-9452-b4995ade354c-6,it s a really good game but i have a some suggestions.,5
5880f046-3a22-4dd9-8b01-ab6dea2bd4f6-9,i check my internet it s connected.,2
7cdfbc5a-b689-406b-b4be-4fdde5b0c61c-5,i get error messages often saying i was dropped from the server or that the matchmaker is full.,3
45093798-da0f-42ae-8624-9ea0bb122b14-2,you ll have to wait for the results like a bouncer keeping you out of the club.,3
1400a34f-784e-41da-9852-1d1e128ac93a,the creators found a concept and design that are both fun and a great way to entertain oneself when needed.,3
94561d27-7cb2-4e0d-93d7-49bd26506df0-2,but then i got a new phone and now the app won t open.,3
bf8a6c07-0611-47de-ad37-70bea17bd6e9-6,"also, parts of the game don t make sense.",4
0a52f5d6-338b-47ea-829d-e720d489a50b-2,we play it a couple times a week.,5
e2a64472-3040-4fe7-b5fe-a73e55964868-2,please add a time limit option to allow more time.,3
e5664a8b-3418-4b00-ba76-20ff1fcd9680-8,this is the first evidence of ai in an online supposed real person mode.,3
b5f15a88-72f3-458e-94e2-d643b2e09e82-8,then i landed on chance and received the same card as the first guy advance token to boardwalk .,5
7fd80936-3811-483c-b738-8a34a03d5a0c-2,i bought a few of the packs and one of them was the write your own deck.,4
2d18c322-0c43-45c1-8726-98776a2d6e6c-4,many of the games i had already purchased were now bundled and i had to purchase them again!,3
cea6f897-f1f7-41e4-8c11-16807ba4c264-6,i offered everything i had plus one thousand dollars and the ai refused my trade.,3
a4b4283e-d79d-4d35-a160-36138403d927-6,that s how our society and economy work.,5
a742d087-bcc4-4c8b-b2d3-3c6d74172f19-10,the third and final thing i would love to see added is a report button.,4
b06928d0-b899-4959-bf0a-e11c7c3dd575-3,but now if i scroll through the list i accidentally delete items from the list.,3
02aaf43f-842d-4c35-971d-38c7be5b5f92-3,"however, the app is not working and every time i try to open it, the screen turns black and i get kicked out of the app.",1
b9d2d1e9-9a8f-410e-b83a-f7406f0f20b7-2,and that would make those people stop playing among us!,5
364c3d4a-2a04-4710-82d7-6654edcc9ae0-2,"i love this game, paid the dollar for it and now it either glitches or the play button won t even show up.",1
1f456097-1aef-40b0-8ef7-994628f94cee-7,it s a fun game most of the time but it seems to be more malicious rng than a skill game.,2
b3d79bc1-82a8-4101-be53-8e02b5b5e43c-7,especially because the game is culture friendly.,5
e9a29e53-a69e-414f-bda2-c4775135e9b4-4,oh yeah one more thing.,3
75c9ebd6-726c-42fb-ac1d-9908cac10128-9,"i could be casually playing and it would glitch so bad, it would crash!",4
8bd75aeb-95b4-4e83-b978-62e3bc6b406e-3,i love this game with all my heart and my goal is to own all of the decks!,4
6fcc0f4e-dd24-4243-a644-26378ce57e28-9,this game has been there sense the start and came out rough into the best sandbox game i have ever played.,5
8f11f63e-45eb-4c46-a637-1529dbd8c9d9-13,that s just uncalled for.,1
ea60ec97-350f-4a88-a486-92a55305056b-10,"this app is truly my only reason to live, and honestly, i dont need a better one.",5
58432700-b9b5-4d81-b96c-06aea75a71d7-5,"it makes the game a little less fun, but it is still great.",4
8bd75aeb-95b4-4e83-b978-62e3bc6b406e-4,i love love looove this app!,4
0e8274f4-2292-4fd1-ad28-b6f085597ae8-13,i ve played this since i was 4 years old and i still do!,5
a3ca0bf4-1311-4c37-9cd5-0d527c73d26c-6,"however reading the reviews, i find two issues that have popped up numerous times on other reviews that i am also experiencing also.",2
00ee8503-9fe4-4d23-99ed-809d015625da-12,"and if you re under 13 or whatever age it is, it won t even let you chose your own name!",2
9e3c68dc-9912-4924-90ab-531ca4336bfc-5,"i ve even had friends try to beat the level, and other people who have played games similar to this.",4
45093798-da0f-42ae-8624-9ea0bb122b14-3,because they don t know what they re doing and trades don t happen at all until the end of the game.,3
45519aa1-3d98-4364-b7b1-d77c371cd750-2,"this is a great way to test your memory, while having fun doing it and enjoying your family, friends or students.",5
dd1f0710-5ae1-4bda-af6d-c60c7c128c41,"i i mean they... would probably pay for it in an in app purchase, 1.99 sounds pretty good, just sayin",5
7650780e-fcc0-4e86-9ab4-d5caae581895-3,i d like to suggest an update with a save the game feature?,4
891426c5-dfcf-4092-a5d0-1d9bbc932eec-9,and maybe you could add some guns in the game.,5
99da3289-e808-4df7-84ce-b8a6842d81bd-11,the klunky repetitious and nonsensical offers they make are pretty bad.,3
007db83a-7e68-4010-9384-97f1062b726f-6,i don t play many mobile games and especially match tile types .,2
b88fcfc2-5d23-4964-894a-b1b8f3486fc4-9,i am really enjoying the newest update very much!,4
e3c49efd-0501-442c-a09d-2d247e868e97-12,"some times, i have to spend like 20 minutes trying to connect my game.",2
891426c5-dfcf-4092-a5d0-1d9bbc932eec-10,it constantly updates proving it won t go out of business for a whiiiiiiiiiiile.,5
b1d7e299-ad74-4e9b-b627-49572b67176b-12,"the idea is classic, like mafia but in space.",5
85d7924d-c6d7-463c-a54c-1d5e57bb3812-6,"don t get me wrong, i love this game, but it seems a little slow.",4
e9a29e53-a69e-414f-bda2-c4775135e9b4-5,and i ll change the rating to 5 star if that happens .,3
0bca0bba-df15-4394-9014-47e7cc7af1cd-8,"also, when we were voting, i was a ghost and i only saw orange and yellow and i know orange was the imposter since i was dead.",3
1a287436-a756-4bab-a7bf-0f719c3dd0a1-3,"the whole point of the game, as i have stated, is the deception and honesty that can not be used with the new chat system.",3
fc29cdbd-387d-409d-ac19-7c3510118466-3,"this is a good app to play when you re waiting in a long line for something, cause it will help pass the time!",5
dd94a46c-4627-4b83-9f85-0895b63a23f2-5,"and there are game ending graphical errors, too.",3
66666fc7-36b0-43c6-afbf-af1879f6e44b-8,it definitely can help pass time.,5
fecb80a9-68a3-461a-905b-d403aa138349-12,i m really lucky because i didn t use any money to buy anything.,2
593a74f5-9d70-4912-b178-8dd988360e1d-6,the reward to effort is completely unfair.,4
89fdd7c3-fc7d-421f-be79-6e7e64ee25a1-14,it would be nice for a friending system!,4
278a2c73-851e-4428-9728-3ebcbebe2104-4,and the score board that you can look on like if you haven t played in months then ya your probably at the very bottom.,3
cc70396b-3eae-4c5e-8ff4-f15c73789388-8,sometimes the characters can be up to 2.99 in real money or a whole heck of a lot in game money.,4
ac0179c2-47df-4783-8a70-474eba172c7b-5,"so you see the system of quick chat is pretty flawed, specially if there s a new player in the game that doesn t even know how to chat.",3
f2a46d13-f77a-4a41-a7ad-d82ef91ecff3-3,"however, it isn t free, and the algorithms are very poor.",1
7f791726-cc3f-4531-b422-1f096124b4c3-8,"when the battery thing pops up , it gives you three seconds after that and and then you can play .",5
8ecbfd5c-0678-4306-9479-603f5e517b66-5,"the other ads are for rewards, which makes it worth it.",5
18e71327-ad42-445d-82f0-a06a9a26ff0f-12,another thing is that the power ups are so short!,3
27cdee13-cf36-42b9-9a54-5ec80485ecb9-8,i also can t stand the magnetic ability in them.,4
28608353-57c6-49f1-a987-1432f11b0d5f-11,"the next turn, the computer acquired a railroad from another computer to re up the price.",1
278a2c73-851e-4428-9728-3ebcbebe2104-5,i like that the background changes and how you can get keys to save your life too.,3
10516dbb-0f2d-4246-a5a4-2980fac62540-8,austin and his neighbors make me happy!,5
605a6501-2804-42df-b770-79e812b05aa0-2,i also think that this games characters are a little over priced.,3
600892e8-1dd3-4d6e-b8ab-3614f766755e-11,"if i was frustrated before, i m finding it hard to express myself now.",2
76789c61-7918-43e3-94f3-eb79f6970a91-14,after reading so many complaints on here and the developers never even answer one of them.,1
68afb506-2141-4067-ba2f-958c28c0dc8f-14,"and when i go into one the minigames, that minigame being high school roleplay there are problems with my custom skin.",5
82637c13-7dd9-4ec9-8d2b-05c2bb0f5458-4,i was super excited to play this game because my boyfriend had installed it on his computer and i wanted to play with him.,3
33cd6729-ec66-480d-a3af-e48343aae0f6-4,at first it was cool and you know like fun.,3
75c9ebd6-726c-42fb-ac1d-9908cac10128-10,"however, when there isn t a deal or a promotion for the shop the items can be quite expensive.",4
2ac64258-3449-4a03-a15f-ba5d86f62013-8,also they do not have any type of communication system so you can t talk to your opponents.,2
859c5a3c-7bf8-462f-bd6f-0f5fa8a1c28a-7,only reason not one star is because i didn t technically review the update features.,2

7b75175e-2bd6-44a5-956c-29756e3fed5a-2,is there any way i could show proof i was there and get the deck for free?,5
ef25299a-c3a7-4c6d-8af0-3d58f05ba757-4,"also, a way to make this less of a problem is to give people the option to not use the new chat so they could type what they want.",2

8bd75aeb-95b4-4e83-b978-62e3bc6b406e-6,when i select that deck it freezes my app to where i have to completely quit out of the app and reload it to make it work again.,4

99da3289-e808-4df7-84ce-b8a6842d81bd-14,"but they re fun to push around and like i said, they create a whole new dimension in game play.",3
344a2fc7-2088-4394-abb3-54945b9975bd-7,but it wasn t always that way... if you find and defeat the forden a small mob that is is visible but will fade if you look at it.,5

dba947fb-b3f3-42c0-860c-ec54f15682d0-11,i really like this game and gardenscapes but it is getting very discouraging to play.,3

c6fc1d76-0d61-4526-9c6b-0a69b432499e-6,i understand that anything can happen in a dice roll but it seems the dice rolls are scripted.,3
1f456097-1aef-40b0-8ef7-994628f94cee-10,no sense continuing if i already know it s a dead match.,2
37569db5-9b2e-451b-9860-5bbbf8713f70-7,i am slightly annoyed when they land on a flat surface when it should be landing on top of the buildings.,4

b68214e4-800c-480e-99db-8e49f4dffea4-7,"a lot of people feel this same way which is probably why the game is so successful and although that s good, it comes with a price.",5
1773f558-5c9b-4ffd-9a6e-c771fd297e4b-11,sometimes i would close the entire game and reopen it only to find that the world wouldn t even pop up.,1
cddbce94-aa5c-4044-b1b0-701e592c3913-7,it is really hard to play the game with a chat limit.,4
