# Beyond Stars: Bridging the Gap Between Ratings and Review Sentiment with LLM

**Research Implementation for AICCSA 2025**

This repository contains the implementation for the paper **‚ÄúBeyond Stars: Bridging the Gap Between Ratings and Review Sentiment with LLM‚Äù** (AICCSA 2025). The framework addresses the limits of traditional star-rating systems by using Large Language Models (LLMs) to capture nuanced feedback that numeric ratings often miss.

## üéØ Research Objectives

Star ratings alone rarely reflect the full story in review text. Our LLM-based framework bridges this gap by:

- **Extracting rich insights** from free-form reviews (aspects, sentiments, recommendations).
- **Capturing linguistic nuances** (hedging, sarcasm, contrastive praise/critique).
- **Providing actionable feedback** for product teams.
- **Enabling interactive analysis** through evidence-grounded Q&A.

## üß© Framework Overview

**Core Architecture.** A modular, hybrid multi-stage pipeline where each component runs independently or as an end-to-end system, combining traditional NLP baselines with advanced LLM techniques.

- **M1 ‚Äî Discrepancy Analysis (Baseline):**  
  VADER-based sentiment ‚Üí mapped to 1‚Äì5 scale ‚Üí absolute difference vs. star rating.

- **M2 ‚Äî ABSA + Recommendation Mining:**  
  Structured prompting with domain examples to extract **(aspect, sentiment, recommendation)** triples.

- **M3 ‚Äî LLM-Enhanced Topic Modeling:**  
  BERTopic for clusters, with LLM-generated topic **labels** and **summaries**.

- **M4 ‚Äî RAG-Based Conversational QA:**  
  Interactive, **evidence-backed** question answering over large review sets.

### Multi-LLM Architecture

- **GPT-4 / GPT-4o** ‚Äî primary for complex reasoning & structured outputs  
- **LLaMA-2-7B-chat** ‚Äî open-source alternative for accessibility & comparison  
- **Mistral-7B** ‚Äî efficient, high-quality responses  
- **Unified Interface** ‚Äî seamless provider switching via a standardized `ChatFn` interface

### Multi-Dataset Validation

- Evaluated on **AWARE**, **Google Play**, and **Spotify** review corpora  
- **Scalable** from small samples to **80K+** reviews with intelligent caching
